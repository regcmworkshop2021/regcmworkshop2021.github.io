THE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS</b></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The
Department of Physics, Dibrugarh University was established in 1967.
It has a rich tradition of teaching and research. The Department aims
to provide quality education in Physics both at the undergraduate and
postgraduate levels; to create an atmosphere for the creation of new
knowledge through methodical research. The Department regularly holds
interactions with eminent visitors, national workshops and research
seminars. 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Currently,
the Department offers the following Academic Programmes :</p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><b>Condensed
Matter Physics (CMP) Group:</b></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The
CMP group consists of 8 faculty members (3 Associate Professors, 5
Assistant Professors) of the department and their students. The
experimental group is working on sol-gel glasses for optical
applications, thin film solar cells, gas sensors,  production and
study of metal and semiconductor nano-particles for gas sensing and
optical applications.  
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The
research interest of the theoretical CMP group lies in the
application of density functional theory (DFT) method in order to
study structural, electronic, magnetic, optical and catalytic
properties of various nanomaterials.  The group has undertaken the
following research problems on DFT study of (a)The nature of
molecular hydrogen adsorption on alkali metal clusters, (b) Graphene
Quantum Dots as toxic metal ion sensors and (c) Optoelectronic
application of graphene based systems. Another important research
work carried out by theoretical CMP group is related to
superconducting heterostructures and spintronics based devices.</p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><b>Astrophysics,
Cosmology and High Energy Physics Group:</b></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The
group consists of 8 faculty members (1 Professor, 1 Associate
Professor, 6 Assistant Professors) of the department and their
students. Presently the group is involved in the areas of Gamma-Ray
Astronomy (GRA), Gravitational Wave Astrophysics (GWA), Astrophysics,
Cosmology and High Energy Physics . The GRA  work is basically
related with gamma-hardon separation techniques of gamma-ray
experiments, the GWA work is related with the study of properties of
gravitational waves in modified theories of gravity. In Astrophysics,
the work is related with study of dark matter and compact star's
oscillations. Cosmology work is based on supersymmetric hybrid
inflation as well as on understanding of dark energy from the aspects
of modified gravity and scalar field models. Another work is related
to computer simulation and study of Extensive air showers initiated
by Very high energy gamma rays from astrophysical sources. In HEP, a
research work is going on in neutrino physics   focusing on the
theoretical study of neutrino mass and mixing modeling. Holographic
studies on the gravitational systems using AdS CFT techniques have
been carried out in a number of works.</p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><b>Atmospheric
Sciences Group:</b></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The
group consists of 3 faculty members (1 Professor, 2 Assistant
Professors) of the department. and their students.  The group is
working on study of ionospheric error and correction for the
satellite based navigation systems like IRNSS. It operates two
ionosondes and four GPS/GNSS receiver chain in the low latitude
region of NE India. It has developed an indigenous ionosonde in
collaboration with SAMEER, Mumbai. Through observational as well as
modeling study of the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly and its effect
such L band scintillations, the group is actively contributing to the
ISRO’ space science program and receives funding though RESPOND
program. Using the regional climate model the group is studying
extensively for the chemical atmosphere over South and South East
Asia. The group is involved in developing in house model for
ion-electron density and temperature to study dynamics of the low
latitude ionosphere. The group is also working on&nbsp; 'Modeling the
impact&nbsp;of aerosols/gases on regional climate and weather
extremes over Sub Himalayan North Eastern Region” under&nbsp;the
National Network Programme on Human and Institutional Capacity
Building (HICAB).</p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><b>Electronics
Group:</b></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The
group consists of 3 faculty members (3 Assistant Professors) of the
department and their students. The group is presently working on
various antenna designs such as microstrip antenna, MIMO antenna,
glass plate antenna etc. The focus of the research work is to design
ultra wideband, compact and high gain antennas. The research interest
also lies in the observation of the shift in resonant frequency due
to covering of the radiation patch of the antenna by liquids of
different dielectric constants.  The group is exclusively using the
simulation software e.g. Ansoft HFSS, CST microwave studio etc. The
research group is also involved in the development of different
algorithms/program codes based on soft computing techniques to
optimize the basic antenna parameters.
